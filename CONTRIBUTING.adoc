= Contributing to AffineScript Playground

== Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Sign off commits (`git commit -s`)
4. Submit a pull request

== Development Setup

[source,bash]
----
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/affinescript-playground.git
cd affinescript-playground

# Install dependencies (Deno required per RSR)
deno task dev

# Run tests
just test
----

== Commit Guidelines

* Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
* Sign all commits (DCO required)
* Atomic, focused commits

== Code Style

* ReScript for application logic (per RSR Language Policy)
* Deno for runtime (not Node/npm/bun per RSR)
* Descriptive variable names (annotated)
* No TypeScript - use ReScript instead

== Affine Type Guidelines

When working with affine types:

* Ensure resources are used at most once
* Document ownership transfer clearly
* Test for resource leak prevention
* Verify WASM output for correctness

== Testing

[source,bash]
----
# Run all tests
just test

# Check affine type safety
just check-affine

# Analyze WASM output
just analyze-wasm
